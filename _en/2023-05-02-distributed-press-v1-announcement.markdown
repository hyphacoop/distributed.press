<p style="text-align:start">Thanks to a grant and support from the <a href="https://www.ffdweb.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web</a> and after months of working away on v1 of Distributed.Press, we’re happy to announce that it’s ready to be tried and tested!</p><h2 style="text-align:start" id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2><p style="text-align:start">For those who aren’t in the loop, <a href="https://distributed.press/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">distributed.press</a> is a tool developed at Hypha that makes it easy to publish static websites to the <a href="https://getdweb.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Distributed Web</a>. Specifically, it gives you an HTTP API to send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">tar archive files</a>, which it will then extract and publish onto <a href="https://ipfs.tech/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://holepunch.to/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Holepunch</a> (formerly hypercore-protocol). It also comes with a custom DNS server, making it easier to set up custom domain names for your sites.</p><h2 style="text-align:start" id="project-overhaul">Project Overhaul</h2><p style="text-align:start">This has involved a <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/pull/48" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">major rewrite</a> in how Distributed Press works under the hood.</p><p style="text-align:start">It’s now easier to set up DNS records across all our supported protocols via the <a href="https://www.dnslink.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">DNSLink</a> specification and Distributed.Press’s newly built-in DNS server.</p><p style="text-align:start">We’ve changed how peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols are integrated so that we can easily add new ones like BitTorrent or Earthstar. We have also reworked the way we publish to <a href="https://www.ipfs.tech/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">IPFS</a> so that new updates can be published to the network almost instantaneously without needing to wait for DNS updates. And we have upgraded our <a href="https://github.com/hypercore-protocol" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Hypercore</a> integration to use the newly rebranded <a href="https://holepunch.to/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Holepunch</a> libraries which adds significant performance and reliability improvements.</p><p style="text-align:start">If you’re part of a community that does P2P file transfer and would like to see your protocol integrated, open up an issue on <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=support_new_protocol.md&amp;title=Support+new+protocol%3A+" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">our GitHub repo</a> with information about your protocol and we can chat about integration from there.</p><h2 style="text-align:start" id="sutty-cms">Sutty CMS</h2><p style="text-align:start">As part of this effort we have been working with <a href="https://sutty.nl/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Sutty</a> on integrating Distributed.Press into their Content Management System (CMS) and using it to have a graphical front-end for editing sites.</p>
