## Our Vision

We are building the _Distributed Press_—a beginner friendly, open-source publishing tool for the distributed web. Aiming to empower authors, _Distributed Press_ utilizes the distributed web to amplify free expression worldwide, while exposing sources of misinformation.

We all have a sense of the wide-ranging and complex issues facing publishing today: political censorship, disinformation, walled gardens, and the [decline of independent media][decline of independent media]. Yet the solutions to these challenges remain unclear. Working with authors, audiences, and distributed web communities, we hope to co-develop new tools, in order to make publishing fair, democratic, and dignified for all.

Our approach is to engage and learn from broader communities who actively research the issues outlined above and those that practice alternative publishing models. With them, we wish to investigate if and how the distributed web can better serve the publishing ecosystem. As a means to this end, we are launching a journal for and by the citizens of the distributed web, and test its resilience against the challenges facing publishing today.

This journal is our sandbox, our lab bench, and the seed that will eventually become the _Distributed Press_ publishing tool for anyone to use.

## Today, centralized platforms wield disproportionate power

Facebook, Tencent, and Google now mediate a majority of global public discourse.

## The distributed web is an emerging democratic alternative

A [vibrant and growing community][vibrant and growing community] is re-imagining the web, where "users" are first-class participants.

> Beaker's success so far has been making authoring and publishing a first-class experience of the web, not as data submitted to a server, but as actual HTML sites authored from scratch. It's a love letter to the web's original design: "the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal".

## We are trapped by network effects

Centralized platforms with large networks like Facebook and Medium are still unmatched for promoting and discovering new content.

Content authors and audiences who are attracted to the promise of the distributed web are compelled to maintain a presence on centralized platforms in order to access wider viewership and content.

With the inherently fragmented nature of the distributed web, content dissemination and discovery is a recognized challenge. However, initiatives such as [IndieWeb][IndieWeb]'s syndication model and [Micro.blog][Micro.blog]'s decoupling of the timeline from post storage have shown us an encouraging path forward.

## Verifiable sources in a fragmented ecosystem

Imagine if authors published content in their entirety rather than as a hyperlink, directly to your favourite social networks or the aggregation sites where discussions happen. It would be important for the authenticity of the content to be verifiable to prevent replication and piracy, irrespective of an origin website that serves as a single source of truth.

To establish authenticity, we can disseminate content along with digital signatures by the author, publisher, or other fact-checking bodies, such as organizations like [Civil][Civil] that aims to uphold journalistic ethics.

Signed messages also allow authors to distribute peer-to-peer payments in order to crowdfund their work. Crowdfunded public interest publications like [Ricochet][Ricochet] and digital currency supported [Popula][Popula], exemplify this concept.

## Censorship resistant content dissemination

Distributed web technologies [claim to resist centralized censors][claim to resist centralized censors]. But even the most distributed technologies have [chokepoints that can be exploited][chokepoints that can be exploited] by private or state actors to undermine people's free expression. As a result, circumventing censorship [necessitates particular practices][necessitates particular practices].

We plan to utilize tools such as the [OONI Probe][OONI Probe] to measure worldwide content dissemination and evaluate compatibility of distributed web protocols with independently operated network infrastructure, such as [offline mesh networks][offline mesh networks] where packets travel through channels out of reach from state censors.
