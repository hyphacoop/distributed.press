## Our Vision

We are building the _Distributed Press_ — a beginner friendly, open-source publishing tool for the distributed web. Aiming to empower authors, _Distributed Press_ utilizes peer-to-peer and decentralized protocols to amplify free expression worldwide, while exposing sources of misinformation.

We all have a sense of the wide-ranging and complex issues facing publishing today: political censorship, disinformation, walled gardens, and the decline of independent media. Yet the solutions to these challenges remain unclear. Working with authors, audiences, and distributed web communities, we hope to co-develop new tools, in order to make publishing fair, democratic, and dignified for all.

Our approach is to engage and learn from broader communities who actively research the issues outlined above, and those that practice alternative publishing models. With them, we wish to investigate if and how the decentralized web can better serve the publishing ecosystem.
